        Everyday is the same. wake up, eat, work, sleep, repeat.

        Today was much the same. Woke up, had a microwave breakfast sandwich,
        forty minute commute to work, said hello to sandra like usual. There
        it was in her smile, in her eyes, all over her face. She had fallen
        in love. I was happy for her, but also sad. I wanted to be the one
        she shared her life with, but I was not. "What's got you smilling so 
        bright today?" I asked her. "Alex brought in banana bread" she said,
        pointing to the break room. "BANANA BREAD? AT WORK? OH YEAH!"
